## Web
Real shame starts from the very basic of Web development. We are doing web apps, but do not even know how the Internet (or the Web) works. That's why junior developers do not understand where from params appear and what makes different type of HTTP requests different. Unfortunately it prepares the ground to believe in magic in future.

If you feel yourself confident in basic Web knowledge and want to dive deeper in all aspects, read [High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/) free ebook. 

>This book provides a hands-on overview of what every web developer needs to know about the various types of networks (WiFi, 3G/4G), transport protocols (UDP, TCP, and TLS), application protocols (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2), and APIs available in the browser (XHR, WebSocket, WebRTC, and more) to deliver the best—fast, reliable, and resilient—user experience.

## Linux
A lot of us come to web dev with Windows desktops. But even if Ruby can be installed on Windows - I recommend to use Linux machine for Ruby development. Real OS setup or a virtual machine.  
It requires to be familiar with some Linux distribution, for example Ubuntu or some other Top 10 distros.

## IDE
You can write Ruby code in any text editor, but using more sophisticated IDE increases productivity.  
Editors like SublimeText and Atom require some additional plugin setup. The most full-featured IDE is RubyMine, but it is not free.  
Due to dynamic composition in Ruby it is hard for IDEs to do correct autocomplete most of the times, that's why RubyMine does not show it's full power. But it still provides quite a lot of additional tools integrated.
